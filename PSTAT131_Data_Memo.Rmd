#PSTAT 131 Data Memo

## Overview of Dataset  
My dataset includes 41 columns, each containing stats about Pokemon (hp, name, capture rate, etc.) from the Pokemon games. I will be obtaining the data from a Kaggle dataset: [Pokemon Stats Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasanarcas/pokemon-stats-dataset). The Kaggle dataset was scraped from the [Pokemon Database](https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/all). There are 801 observations and 40 predictors. I will be working with both quantitative/numeric variables (hp, capture rate, etc.) and qualitative/categorical variables (Pokemon type, etc.). The data does have missing values in the height (2% missing), weight (2% missing), percentage of that Pokemon that are male (12% missing), and the second type of the Pokemon (48% missing). I do not plan to use the first three of those predictors in analysis (since I will not be using all 40 predictors), but if I find in my EDA that the variables appear to be significant, I would impute the missing values with the averages of those columns. As for the second type of the Pokemon, it is fitting that this column has the greatest percentage of missing data because only specific Pokemon have second types. I would like to use type in my analysis so I will either only take the first main type into account or maybe compare Pokemon with one versus two types.  

## Overview of Research Question(s)  
I am interested in predicting the capture rate (capture_rate) of the Pokemon. I would like to whether specific qualities about a Pokemon (hp, speed, type, etc.) make it harder to capture. The response is the capture rate of the Pokemon (capture_rate). The capture rate is measured in the Pokedex on a scale from 0 to 255, with higher values being associated with easier capture. Since the response is numeric/quantitative, I think the questions will be answered with a regression approach. I think the predictors that will be especially useful are the hp, type, and maybe whether the Pokemon is legendary or not because those qualities have made Pokemon either harder or easier for me to capture in my own experience. The goal of my model is to be a combination of all three types of models. I would like to illustrate any visible trends variables have in relation to the capture rate (descriptive). I would also like to predict the capture rate based on all the chosen variables (predictive), but I think it would definitely be beneficial to look into whether specific variables influence capture rate more than others (inferential).  
  
## Proposed Project Timeline   
**Week 1**: *Search for data, complete Data Memo*  
**Week 2**: *Load data, tidy*      
**Week 3**: *Run EDA, write up analysis (EDA)*      
**Week 4**: *Run EDA, write up analysis (EDA)*         
**Week 5**: *Run different models, write down analysis of what happens in each model (Feature Extraction, Data Splitting, Model Fitting)*     
**Week 6**: *Run different models, write down analysis of what happens in each model (Feature Extraction, Data Splitting, Model Fitting)*   
**Week 7**: *Run different models, write down analysis of what happens in each model (Feature Extraction, Data Splitting, Model Fitting)*   
**Week 8**: *Write up results (Narration)*    
**Week 9**: *Write up entire draft of paper, make edits (Narration, Code, Organization & Structure)*    
**Week 10**: *Double check final draft of project and submit*    

## Questions or Concerns  
My main concern with the project is whether we will learn everything we need to know to complete our projects as we go. I would be really stressed if we learned a key component of my project closer to the end of the quarter and I had to scramble to get that work done. Is there any way to adjust for this? Other than that, I am all good!
